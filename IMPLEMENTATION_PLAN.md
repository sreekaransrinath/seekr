# Implementation Plan for Podcast Content Management Agent

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Structure
### Step 1.1: Initialize Project Environment
- **Action**: Create project directory structure and initialize Python virtual environment
- **Verifiable Output**: 
  - Directory structure created: `/src`, `/data`, `/output`, `/tests`, `/config`
  - `requirements.txt` file with dependencies listed
  - `.env` file for API keys (mock or real)
  - `README.md` with initial structure

### Step 1.2: Define Core Data Models
- **Action**: Create data schemas for podcast transcripts, summaries, and fact-check results
- **Verifiable Output**:
  - `models.py` with Pydantic/dataclass models for:
    - `PodcastTranscript`, `Episode`, `Summary`, `KeyNotes`, `FactCheckResult`
  - Unit tests in `/tests/test_models.py` that validate model instantiation

## Phase 2: Input Processing Module
### Step 2.1: Build Transcript Parser
- **Action**: Implement parser to handle JSON transcript format
- **Verifiable Output**:
  - `transcript_parser.py` that successfully loads all 3 sample files
  - Test output: Console log showing parsed episode metadata (title, host, guests, sections)
  - Error handling for malformed JSON

### Step 2.2: Create Data Validation Layer
- **Action**: Validate transcript structure and clean data
- **Verifiable Output**:
  - Validation report for each episode showing:
    - Number of segments parsed
    - Timestamp format validation results
    - Missing field detection
  - Test case: Intentionally corrupt one JSON file and verify error handling

## Phase 3: Summarization Agent
### Step 3.1: Implement Core Summarization Logic
- **Action**: Create summarizer using LLM API (OpenAI/Anthropic/local)
- **Verifiable Output**:
  - `summarizer.py` module with configurable prompt templates
  - Test output: 200-300 word summary for each episode saved to `/output/summaries/`
  - Logging showing token usage and API calls

### Step 3.2: Add Section-Aware Processing
- **Action**: Process transcripts by sections (Introduction, Deep Dive, etc.)
- **Verifiable Output**:
  - Summary includes all sections mentioned in transcript
  - Test: Verify each section type appears in final summary
  - Performance log: Processing time per episode

## Phase 4: Key Notes Extraction Agent
### Step 4.1: Build Takeaway Extractor
- **Action**: Extract top 5 takeaways from each episode
- **Verifiable Output**:
  - JSON file with 5 takeaways per episode
  - Each takeaway is 1-2 sentences
  - Test: Verify no duplicate takeaways across episodes

### Step 4.2: Implement Quote Extraction
- **Action**: Extract notable quotes with timestamps
- **Verifiable Output**:
  - At least 3 quotes per episode with accurate timestamps
  - Quotes formatted as: `"[timestamp] Speaker: Quote text"`
  - Test: Verify timestamp format consistency

### Step 4.3: Create Topic Tagger
- **Action**: Generate topic tags for each episode
- **Verifiable Output**:
  - 5-10 topic tags per episode
  - Tags saved in standardized format (lowercase, hyphenated)
  - Test: Common tags across episodes identified (e.g., "technology", "future-trends")

## Phase 5: Fact-Checking Agent
### Step 5.1: Build Claim Extractor
- **Action**: Identify factual claims from transcripts
- **Verifiable Output**:
  - List of 5+ factual claims per episode
  - Claims categorized by type (statistics, dates, company names, predictions)
  - Test log showing extraction reasoning

### Step 5.2: Create Mock Knowledge Base
- **Action**: Build local knowledge base for fact verification
- **Verifiable Output**:
  - `knowledge_base.json` with mock facts about:
    - Companies mentioned (GitLab, Automattic, FDA)
    - Technologies (AI in healthcare, remote work stats)
  - Verification endpoint that returns confidence scores

### Step 5.3: Implement Verification Engine
- **Action**: Check claims against knowledge base and mock web search
- **Verifiable Output**:
  - Fact-check table with columns: Claim | Verification | Confidence
  - At least 3 verified claims per episode
  - Mock web search logs showing simulated API calls
  - Test: Inject false claim and verify it's marked as incorrect

## Phase 6: Orchestration & Planning Layer
### Step 6.1: Build Agent Coordinator
- **Action**: Create main orchestrator that manages all sub-agents
- **Verifiable Output**:
  - `orchestrator.py` with sequential task execution
  - Execution plan log showing:
    - Task queue: [Parse â†’ Summarize â†’ Extract â†’ Fact-check]
    - Start/end times for each task
    - Resource allocation decisions

### Step 6.2: Add Reasoning/Planning Module
- **Action**: Implement agent that decides processing strategy
- **Verifiable Output**:
  - Planning log showing decision tree:
    - "Episode length > 1000 words â†’ Use detailed summarization"
    - "Multiple guests â†’ Extract quotes from all speakers"
  - Test: Process episodes of different lengths and verify plan adaptation

## Phase 7: Output Generation
### Step 7.1: Create Output Formatter
- **Action**: Generate final JSON and Markdown outputs
- **Verifiable Output**:
  - `/output/episode_reports/` with one file per episode containing:
    - Summary section
    - Key notes with emojis (ðŸ”¹, ðŸ’¬, ðŸ§­)
    - Fact-check table
  - Both `.json` and `.md` formats

### Step 7.2: Build Aggregate Report
- **Action**: Create consolidated report across all episodes
- **Verifiable Output**:
  - `final_report.md` with:
    - Executive summary of all episodes
    - Common themes identified
    - Aggregated fact-check statistics
    - Processing metrics (time, tokens used)

## Phase 8: Testing & Validation
### Step 8.1: Create End-to-End Test Suite
- **Action**: Build comprehensive test pipeline
- **Verifiable Output**:
  - Test results showing:
    - All 3 episodes processed successfully
    - Output validation (word counts, format checks)
    - Performance benchmarks (< 30 seconds per episode)

### Step 8.2: Generate Agent Reasoning Logs
- **Action**: Create detailed logs showing agent decision-making
- **Verifiable Output**:
  - `agent_reasoning.log` with entries like:
    - "Detected claim about NASA mission â†’ Initiating fact-check"
    - "Summary exceeds 300 words â†’ Applying compression"
    - "Found company name 'GitLab' â†’ Searching knowledge base"

## Phase 9: Deployment Strategy Documentation
### Step 9.1: Write AWS Architecture Design
- **Action**: Document deployment architecture
- **Verifiable Output**:
  - `deployment_strategy.md` (500 words) covering:
    - Lambda functions for each agent
    - S3 for transcript storage
    - DynamoDB for fact-check cache
    - API Gateway for client access
    - Cost estimates with specific AWS service pricing

### Step 9.2: Create Scalability Plan
- **Action**: Document scaling considerations
- **Verifiable Output**:
  - Scaling metrics:
    - Concurrent episode processing capacity
    - Auto-scaling triggers (CPU, queue depth)
    - Rate limiting strategy for LLM APIs
  - Fault tolerance design:
    - Retry logic for failed API calls
    - Dead letter queues for failed episodes
    - Circuit breaker patterns
