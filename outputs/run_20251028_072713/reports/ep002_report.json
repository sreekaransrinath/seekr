Moore highlights patient-facing implementations, specifically smart triage chatbots on hospital platforms that guide patients toward appropriate care pathways before clinical encounters. However, both guests emphasize critical barriers: data privacy concerns and algorithmic bias stemming from skewed training datasets that reflect existing healthcare disparities.\n\nDespite these challenges, AI adoption accelerates due to efficiency gains and clinician support needs. The COVID-19 pandemic particularly catalyzed digital health tool adoption, including AI systems that reduce diagnostic errors and speed up radiology reads. Looking forward, Dr. Patel envisions AI copilots suggesting treatment plans while preserving human clinical judgment as the final authority. Moore stresses that interoperability—secure cross-system communication—will determine AI's ultimate healthcare impact.\n\nThe episode concludes with Chen advocating cautious optimism: AI demonstrates genuine power in specific healthcare applications, but realistic expectations and careful implementation matter more than transformative promises.\n\n**Step 4 - Validation:**\n✓ All sections covered\n✓ All speakers represented with attributed insights\n✓ Specific examples included (X-rays, triage chatbots, FDA review)\n✓ Word count: 247 words",
