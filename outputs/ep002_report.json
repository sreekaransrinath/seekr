AI is assistive, not autonomous, with FDA regulatory barriers preventing full replacement of clinicians\n2. Data bias and privacy are critical challenges since AI learns from potentially skewed clinical datasets\n3. Pandemic-accelerated adoption focuses on efficiency gains through triage chatbots and diagnostic support\n\n**Summary**:\n\nDavid Chen examines the gap between AI healthcare promises and current clinical reality with Dr. Priya Patel and Alex Moore, revealing that today's applications are narrowly focused on supporting, not replacing, human clinicians.\n\nThe conversation establishes that AI diagnostic tools—particularly X-ray readers and urgent case flagging systems—are deployed in hospitals, but operate under strict FDA oversight that prevents autonomous decision-making. Dr. Patel emphasizes these systems remain assistive, with regulatory barriers ensuring human oversight. Moore provides concrete examples patients encounter today: smart triage chatbots on hospital websites that guide next-step decisions before physician consultations.\n\nCritical challenges emerge around data integrity and equity. The guests explain AI systems learn from existing clinical datasets that may contain historical biases, creating privacy and fairness concerns. Despite these obstacles, adoption accelerates because hospitals seek efficiency gains and error reduction. The COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed digital health adoption, making AI tools more acceptable to both institutions and patients.\n\nLooking forward, the discussion points toward AI copilots that suggest treatment plans while preserving human final authority. Dr. Patel stresses that interoperability—enabling secure system communication—will determine AI's ultimate healthcare value. Chen concludes with measured optimism: AI holds power, but cautious, evidence-based implementation remains essential.\n\n**Word Count**: 223 words\n**Validation**: ✓ All sections covered ✓ All speakers represented ✓ Specific insights included ✓ No generalizations",
