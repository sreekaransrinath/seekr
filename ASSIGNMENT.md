Objective
You are building an Agentic AI system that helps an Ad Agency manage podcast content more efficiently. Given raw podcast transcripts, the agent should:
	‚Ä¢	Summarize each episode clearly and concisely.
	‚Ä¢	Extract key takeaways and quotes that are suitable for publishing as show notes or social media highlights.
	‚Ä¢	Proof-check factual claims in the episode (using retrieval or reasoning on a knowledge base or Web Search).
The goal is to demonstrate your ability to design, build, and reason about a multi-step AI agent that autonomously plans and executes tasks.

Input
You will be given:
	‚Ä¢	podcast transcript files (.txt or .json)Each contains:
	‚Ä¢	Host and guest dialogues
	‚Ä¢	Timestamps
	‚Ä¢	Occasional filler words or transcription errors
Example (Format will be similar to the below):
[00:02:14] Host: So NASA recently announced something about a new Mars mission.  
[00:02:18] Guest: Yes, it‚Äôs launching in early 2026 ‚Äî they‚Äôre planning to bring back samples.  
[00:03:01] Host: Wow, that‚Äôs exciting.  

Tasks
1. Summarization
Generate a summary of each episode (~200‚Äì300 words) that captures:
	‚Ä¢	Core themes
	‚Ä¢	Key discussions
	‚Ä¢	Outcomes or opinions shared
2. Key Notes Extraction
Produce a structured list of:
	‚Ä¢	üîπ Top 5 takeaways
	‚Ä¢	üí¨ Notable quotes (with timestamps)
	‚Ä¢	üß≠ Topics discussed (tag-style labels)
3. Fact-Checking (Agentic Component)
Identify factual statements (e.g., ‚ÄúNASA Mars mission launches in 2026‚Äù) and verify them using one or more of:
	‚Ä¢	A retrieval or search API (you can mock this)
	‚Ä¢	A local knowledge base file you create
	‚Ä¢	A reasoning step simulating verification
Mark each as:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Verified true
	‚Ä¢	‚ö†Ô∏è Possibly outdated/inaccurate
	‚Ä¢	‚ùì Unverifiable
Example output:
Claim
Verification
Confidence
NASA‚Äôs Mars mission launches in 2026
True (confirmed by mock NASA DB)
0.92
Bitcoin will reach $200K by 2025
Unverifiable
0.40

4.Deployment Strategy 
In addition to your implementation, describe how you would deploy this agentic system for real-world use by an Ad Agency.
You do not have to implement the deployment, but your answer should include a max of 500 words about Cost, scalability, fault tolerance considerations in deploying the application in AWS.


Deliverables
	‚Ä¢	Source code for your solution
	‚Ä¢	Detailed Readme about how to run your solution
	‚Ä¢	Readable logs or console outputs showing agent reasoning steps or plans (not just final results).
	‚Ä¢	Output JSON or Markdown file with:
	‚Ä¢	Summary
	‚Ä¢	Notes
	‚Ä¢	Fact-check table
	‚Ä¢	Detailed Deployment Strategy
