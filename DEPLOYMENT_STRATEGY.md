# AWS Deployment Strategy for Podcast Content Management Agent

## Architecture Overview

The Podcast Content Management Agent is designed for serverless deployment on AWS, leveraging managed services for scalability, reliability, and cost-efficiency. The architecture supports both synchronous API-driven and asynchronous batch processing workflows.

## Core Components

### 1. Compute Layer - ECS Fargate

**Service**: Amazon ECS with Fargate launch type

The agent runs as containerized tasks on ECS Fargate, eliminating server management while providing automatic scaling. Fargate is preferred over Lambda due to the long-running nature of LLM API calls (30-60 seconds per episode) which exceeds Lambda's optimal use case.

**Configuration**:
- Task definition: 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM per task
- Auto-scaling: 1-10 tasks based on queue depth
- Health checks via Application Load Balancer
- Rolling deployment strategy for zero-downtime updates

**Cost**: ~$0.04 per vCPU-hour + $0.004 per GB-hour = ~$0.10 per task-hour. At 1 minute per episode, processing 1,000 episodes costs approximately $1.67.

### 2. Storage Layer

**Amazon S3** stores:
- Input transcripts (JSON files)
- Generated reports (JSON and Markdown)
- Reasoning logs
- Knowledge base data

Organization: `s3://podcast-agent-{env}/inputs/`, `/outputs/`, `/logs/`, `/knowledge-base/`

Lifecycle policies archive outputs to S3 Glacier after 90 days, reducing storage costs by 80%.

**Cost**: $0.023 per GB/month for standard storage. For 10,000 episodes (~1 GB), annual cost is ~$0.28.

**Amazon DynamoDB** provides:
- Fact-check result caching (claim â†’ verification status)
- Processing job metadata and status tracking
- Request deduplication

Single-table design with GSIs for query flexibility. On-demand billing mode handles variable workloads efficiently.

**Cost**: $1.25 per million write requests, $0.25 per million read requests. Cache hit rate of 50% saves 50% of fact-checking LLM calls.

### 3. Queue and Orchestration

**Amazon SQS** (Standard Queue) manages asynchronous processing:
- Ingestion queue for new episodes
- Dead-letter queue for failed jobs
- Visibility timeout: 5 minutes (accommodates 60s processing + retries)

ECS tasks poll SQS for work, enabling elastic scaling based on queue depth. CloudWatch alarms trigger scaling when `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible` exceeds thresholds.

**Cost**: $0.40 per million requests. Processing 10,000 episodes costs $0.004.

### 4. API Gateway

**Amazon API Gateway** (REST API) exposes endpoints:
- `POST /process` - Submit single episode for processing
- `POST /batch` - Submit multiple episodes
- `GET /status/{job_id}` - Check processing status
- `GET /report/{episode_id}` - Retrieve generated report

Integrates with Lambda authorizers for API key authentication. Request validation ensures transcript schema compliance before reaching ECS.

**Cost**: $3.50 per million API calls + $0.09 per GB data transfer. For 10,000 API calls, cost is $0.035.

### 5. Monitoring and Observability

**Amazon CloudWatch** provides:
- Logs aggregation from all services
- Custom metrics (processing time, token usage, fact-check accuracy)
- Alarms for error rates, queue depth, task failures

**AWS X-Ray** enables distributed tracing across the pipeline, identifying bottlenecks in LLM calls or knowledge base lookups.

**Cost**: $0.50 per GB ingested + $0.03 per GB archived. For 100 GB logs/month, cost is ~$50.

## Deployment Pipeline

**AWS CodePipeline** automates CI/CD:
1. Source stage: GitHub webhook triggers on main branch push
2. Build stage: CodeBuild creates Docker image, runs tests
3. Deploy stage: ECS rolling update with blue/green deployment option

Docker images stored in Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry).

## Scalability Design

### Horizontal Scaling

ECS Service Auto Scaling policies:
- Target tracking: Maintain SQS queue depth at <10 messages per task
- Step scaling: Add 5 tasks if queue depth >50, 10 tasks if >100
- Scale-in protection: 5-minute cooldown prevents thrashing

**Capacity**: With 10 tasks running concurrently, system processes 600 episodes/hour (1 per minute per task).

### Rate Limiting and Cost Control

OpenRouter LLM API rate limits managed via:
- Token bucket algorithm (100 requests/minute)
- Exponential backoff with jitter for retries
- Circuit breaker pattern: Halt processing if error rate >10%

DynamoDB fact-check cache reduces LLM API calls by 40-60% for repeated claims.

## Fault Tolerance and Reliability

### Retry Logic

- SQS message retention: 14 days
- Max receive count: 3 attempts before moving to dead-letter queue
- DLQ monitoring triggers SNS alerts for manual review

### Graceful Degradation

- If knowledge base unavailable, skip fact-checking but complete summarization
- If primary LLM model rate-limited, fallback to secondary model (configurable)
- Checkpointing: Save partial results (summary, quotes) before fact-checking

### Multi-AZ Deployment

ECS tasks distributed across 3 availability zones. ALB health checks route traffic only to healthy tasks.

## Security

- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager stores OpenRouter API keys, rotated every 90 days
- **IAM Roles**: Least-privilege policies for ECS tasks, Lambda functions
- **VPC**: ECS tasks in private subnets, egress via NAT Gateway
- **Encryption**: S3 server-side encryption (SSE-S3), DynamoDB encryption at rest
- **API Security**: API keys for external clients, WAF rules to block malicious traffic

## Cost Breakdown (Monthly)

**Assumptions**: 100,000 episodes/month, avg 1 minute processing time

| Service | Usage | Monthly Cost |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| ECS Fargate | 1,667 task-hours | $167 |
| S3 Storage | 100 GB standard | $2.30 |
| DynamoDB | 10M writes, 50M reads (w/ caching) | $25 |
| SQS | 200,000 requests | $0.08 |
| API Gateway | 100,000 requests | $0.35 |
| CloudWatch Logs | 100 GB ingestion | $50 |
| Data Transfer | 50 GB outbound | $4.50 |
| **LLM API Costs** | 800M tokens @ $3/$15 per 1M | **$6,000** |
| **Total** | | **~$6,250/month** |

**Note**: LLM API costs dominate (96% of total). Optimizing prompts and caching reduces this by 30-40%.

**Per-Episode Cost**: $0.0625 (~6 cents)

## Scaling to 1M Episodes/Month

- Increase ECS task limit to 100 (processes 6,000 episodes/hour)
- Enable DynamoDB auto-scaling (provision 500-5,000 WCUs)
- Implement S3 Transfer Acceleration for faster uploads
- Use CloudFront CDN for report delivery
- Estimated cost: ~$60,000/month (LLM costs ~$58,000)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Parallel Processing**: Use AWS Step Functions to parallelize summarization, extraction, and fact-checking after parsing
2. **Vector Search**: Replace mock knowledge base with Amazon OpenSearch for semantic claim retrieval
3. **Real-Time Fact-Checking**: Integrate Perplexity API for live web search
4. **Edge Deployment**: Use Lambda@Edge for low-latency report delivery
5. **Multi-Region**: Deploy to us-east-1, eu-west-1, ap-southeast-1 for global coverage

## Conclusion

This AWS serverless architecture provides a scalable, cost-effective solution for the Podcast Content Management Agent. By leveraging ECS Fargate, S3, DynamoDB, and SQS, the system handles variable workloads efficiently while maintaining fault tolerance. The primary cost driver is LLM API usage, which scales linearly with volume. Strategic caching and prompt optimization can reduce operational costs by 30-40%, making the per-episode cost highly competitive at ~4 cents.
