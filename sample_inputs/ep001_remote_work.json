      "text": "Absolutely. So Mark, a lot of people equate remote work with working from anywhere. But is that the full picture?"

    {
      "timestamp": "00:45",
      "speaker": "Mark",
      "section": "Deep Dive",
      "text": "Not quite. It\u2019s more about async-first culture, documentation, and autonomy. Being remote doesn\u2019t just mean a location; it means structured processes and trust."

      "speaker": "Mark",
      "section": "Deep Dive",
      "text": "Well, look at GitLab, Automattic, and Doist. They\u2019ve literally written handbooks for everything. Employees can figure things out without asking for constant guidance."

      "timestamp": "01:50",

      "section": "Examples",
      "text": "Wow, handbooks instead of manuals. Do you think that scales for smaller teams?"

      "timestamp": "02:05",
      "speaker": "Mark",
      "section": "Examples",
      "text": "Absolutely. Even small teams benefit from clear documentation. It reduces context-switching and keeps knowledge from being siloed."

      "speaker": "Mark",
      "section": "Trends",
      "text": "They help, but tools aren\u2019t the solution. Culture is. Slack is great, but if you rely on it for everything, people will burn out."

      "section": "Challenges",
      "text": "That makes sense. What about loneliness or lack of connection? It\u2019s often cited as a remote work downside."

      "timestamp": "04:10",
      "speaker": "Mark",
      "section": "Challenges",
      "text": "Regular virtual coffee chats, occasional in-person retreats, and team rituals help. Remote doesn\u2019t mean isolated; it just needs intention."
